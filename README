Puttycyg, a Putty-based terminal for Cygwin.

puttycyg was discontinued by its author years ago because there are "plenty
of alternatives".  I don't like any of them and I just want puttycyg back, so I've
updated it to build with current MSVC and Cygwin and rebuilt it.

SSH and other remote terminal features have been stripped out.  Don't use
an ancient fork of Putty that hasn't had security fixes in years for remote
terminals.  Use Putty for that.
